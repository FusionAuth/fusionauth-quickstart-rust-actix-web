# Quickstart: Rust Actix app with FusionAuth

This repo holds an example Rust application that uses FusionAuth as the identity provider.

This repository is documented at https://fusionauth.io/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-rust-actix-web.

## Project Contents

The `docker-compose.yml` file and the `kickstart` directory are used to start and configure a local FusionAuth server.

The `complete-application` directory contains a fully working version of the application.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/#)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) version 20 or later.

## Running FusionAuth

To run FusionAuth, just stand up the docker containers using docker-compose.

First clone the example repo and change into the project directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-rust-actix-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-rust-actix--web
```

Start the containers with docker compose.

```shell
docker compose up
```

This will start three containers for PostgreSQL, Opensearch and FusionAuth.

FusionAuth will initially be configured with these settings:

* Your client id is: `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`
* Your client secret is: `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your fusionAuthBaseUrl is 'http://localhost:9011/'

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker and Kickstart everything will already be configured correctly.

## Running the Example Application

Run the Rust application with:

```shell
cd complete-application
cargo run
```

Browse to the app at http://localhost:9012 and login with `richard@example.com` and `password`.
